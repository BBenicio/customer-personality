# Customer Personality Analysis

Customer Personality Analysis is a detailed analysis of a companyâ€™s ideal customers. It helps a business to better understand its customers and makes it easier for them to modify products according to the specific needs, behaviors and concerns of different types of customers.

In the `customer_personality.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook, we analyse the data, process it, and cluster using different algorithms. After clustering we attempt to visualize it and analyse each of the clusters to see what each cluster represents.

The chosen algorithm and number of clusters achieved a silhouette score of `0.531930125140841`

Our findings are summarized in the text that follows.
